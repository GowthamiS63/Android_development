This project captures live camera frames on Android, processes them in fast native C++ using OpenCV for edge detection, and displays the output using OpenGL. It shows a complete pipeline—Camera2 input, JNI-based C++ processing, and smooth GPU rendering. A simple web viewer is included for showcasing processed images.
